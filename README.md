# ELO-Guesser
An attempt at creating a neural network to guess a player's ELO based on his chess games/moves.

The plan is to use this along with another model that can pick moves from stockfish's top moves to play at a target ELO, 100 points above the predicted of the user. 
Could be a useful trainig tool, or a troll that plays just a tick above your level :P 

### Currently at developement stage
